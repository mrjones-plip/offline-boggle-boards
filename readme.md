# Offline Boggle Boards

This project is the answer to the question, "What's the easiest way to play Boggle on a flight?", but being frustrated that options in the app store all are ad laden.

If you load this app on your laptop while online, it will continue to work without Internet connectivity. Mobile phone support coming soon!

## Using

The easiest way to use this is to go to the web site and then just keep the page open.

You can also download this repo and open the `index.html` page.

## Outstanding features

* [ ] mobile support
* [ ] ability to generate a page full of boards for printing/saving as PDF

## Thanks

I got the idea from [Jim's Boggle Board Generator Perl App](http://xuth.net/programming/bog_cgi/).  Thanks Jim!
