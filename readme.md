# Offline Boggle Boards

This project is the answer to the question, "What's the easiest way to play Boggle on a flight without internet?", but being frustrated that options in the app store all are ad laden.

If you load this app on your phone while online, it will continue to when offline, without Internet connectivity.

## Using

The easiest way to use this is to go to [the website](https://mrjones-plip.github.io/offline-boggle-boards/) and then just keep the page open.

You can also download this repo and open the `index.html` page and open it in a browser.

After the page is loaded.  When you're ready to play a new game, click the "New Game" button. The dice will change color when the game ends and the 3 minute timer runs out.

## FAQ

1. **Q:** Help! The board is too big in my browser and going off the screen! What do I do!

   **A:** Make the browser window narrower.
